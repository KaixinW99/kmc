# nevery
for a simulation at 298K with a preexponential factor of 6e-7
the value of nevery*timestep that is safe to use depends on the potential
Here are some reference values for common potentials

Potential     nevery*timestep
0.1 V         3514
0.2 V         501
0.3 V         71
0.4 V         10
0.5 V         1.5

For higher potentials there might be necessary to decrease the timestep
